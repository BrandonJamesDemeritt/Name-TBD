Add this code to beginning of the class

[SerializeField]
private GameObject ability; //The ability of the player. player 1 uses flames. player 2 uses wind. Should contain a particle system
[SerializeField]
private KeyCode abilityInput; //Key to be pressed to activate the players ability
[SerializeField]
private int startRotationX; //The starting rotation of the ability's x-axis

Add this code in the update function

add this wherever you control going left

//Rotates the ability to the left
startRotationX = 180;

add this wherever you control going right

//Rotates the ability to the right
startRotationX = 0;

add this wherever you control going up

//Rotates the ability up
startRotationX = -90;

add this wherever you control going down

//Rotates the ability down
startRotationX = 90;

add this to the bottom of the update function

if (Input.GetKeyDown(abilityInput))
{
	ability.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(startRotationX, 90, 90);
	ability.GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().Play();
}//end if
if (Input.GetKeyUp(abilityInput))
{
        ability.GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().Stop();
}//end if
